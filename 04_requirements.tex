\chapter{Design requirements}
\label{Design_requirements}

In this chapter the requirements for the TID sensor will be presented.

The finalised sensor is to be flown on-board the PW-Sat2 CubeSat satellite. Therefore, it should be designed for these particular requirements. In addition, it should be designed with active space standard and launcher requirements in mind. Additional requirements come from CubeSat Design Specification, which summarizes them for CubeSat type satellite \cite{CDS}.

\section{PW-Sat2}
    The presented sensor is scheduled to be launched on the PW-Sat2 satellite \cite{PW-Sat2URL}. Therefore it should be designed especially for this particular type of mission. In this section the PW-Sat2 mission will be presented.

    PW-Sat2 is scheduled to be launched on Falon9 rocket from SpaceX company in Q4 2017.

    \end{figure}




    \subsection{Primary mission}
        The primary mission of PW-Sat2 is to test the deorbit sail. When satellite mission ends, it has to be safely deorbited (or moved to graveyard orbit). Due to new regulations, satellite has to be removed from
        the LEO region no later than 25 years after the end of vehicle operations \cite{Satellite_disposal}. Purpose of deorbit sail is, after satellite operations, to open and increase atmospheric drag, shortening satellite life and cause deorbitation. More information about this experiment can be found in \cite{DDC_article}.

        A render of PW-Sat2 with opened sail is shown in the figure \ref{PW-Sat_render_sail}.

        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.38\paperwidth]{img/04/PW-Sat2_render_02.png}
            \caption{PW-Sat2 with opened sail. Source: \cite{PW_sat2_photo}}
            \label{PW-Sat_render_sail}
        \end{figure}

    \subsection{Lifetime}
        Due to its primary mission, the basic lifetime of PW-Sat2 is planned to be 40 days long. After this time the deorbit sail will be opened and orbit will slowly decay. Deorbitation from nominal orbit is planned to take about one year \cite{PWSAT_MA_CDR}, but possibly with an unreliable data connection. Therefore the sensor should be able to measure the dose absorbed during the primary mission (40 days), but also to work throughout the full predicted mission - about one year.

    \subsection{Orbit}
        PW-Sat2 in planned to be launched to a sun-synchronous circular orbit of attitude \SI{575}{\kilo\meter}, with LTAN of 10:30 \cite{PWSAT_MA_CDR}.


    \subsection{Radiation analysis}
        Simulations in SPENVIS \cite{SPENVIS_URL} were performed to estimate TID accumulated during the PW-Sat2 mission. In the figure \ref{TIDvsSheilding} dose as a function of shielding thickness was plotted, during year-long mission on predicted orbit.

        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.58\paperwidth]{img/04/dose.eps}
            \caption{TID vs shielding during one year mission on \SI{575}{\kilo\meter} orbit}
            \label{TIDvsSheilding}
        \end{figure}

        The shielding of PW-Sat2 is about \SI{0.5}{\milli\meter} thick (aluminum sides as well as aluminum substrate for solar cells - \ref{PW-Sat_render_01}). Therefore, predicted dose during the primary mission is \SI{1}{\kilo\rad} and over the full, one year mission, is about \SI{10}{\kilo\rad}.

\section{Sensor requirements}
    Summing PW-Sat2 mission analysis, high-level sensor requirements were estimated, summarized in the table \ref{sensor_requirements_table}.

    \begin{table}[H]
        \caption{Sensor requirements}
        \label{sensor_requirements_table}
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}{r|l}
                \textbf{Requirement} & \textbf{Value} \\ \hline
                Range & \SI{10}{\kilo\rad} \\
                Resolution & \SI{10}{\rad} \\
                Total accuracy & \SI{\pm 100}{\rad}
            \end{tabular}
        \end{center}
    \end{table}

\section{Applicable standards}
    The sensor should comply to ECSS \cite{ECSS_URL} standards. They are required by the launch provider and describe good practice during space product development.

    ESCIES \cite{ESCIES_URL} provides valuable knowledge about component qualification, testing and verification.

\section{Electrical requirements}
    The sensor will be placed on-board PW-Sat2. Therefore it should comply to its standards - power supplies, communication interfaces etc.

    \subsection{Electronics stack}
        Modules on PW-Sat2 are connected in the PC-104 stack structure as shown in the figure \ref{PW-Sat2_stack}. Is is placed inside the satellite housing and consists of (from the top):
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Payload module (PLD)} - where the sensor will be located,
            \item On-Board Computer (OBC) - main data processing unit,
            \item Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem (ADCS) - controls attitude (detumbling and sunpointing),
            \item Electrical Power System (EPS) - charges and discharges batteries, provides safety mechanisms,
            \item Battery module (ACC) - main energy storage,
            \item Communication transceiver (COMM) - VHF \& UHF full duplex transceiver,
            \item Antennae module (ANT) - antennae for uplink and downlink.
        \end{itemize}

        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.5\paperwidth]{img/04/PW-Sat2-stack.png}
            \caption{PW-Sat2 electronics stack}
            \label{PW-Sat2_stack}
        \end{figure}

    \subsection{PC-104 connector}
        PLD board is connected to OBC with PC-104 connector. This connector provides data and power connections to the satellite bus.

        The connector consists of:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $I^2C$ bus, connected directly to MCU on OBC,
            \item interrupt line on which the sensor can notify OBC about command completion,
            \item SENS \SI{5}{\volt} line, powered only when sensor is commanded to be enabled.
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Power rail}
        As mentioned earlier, the power for the sensor is +\SI{5}{\volt}, activated whenever the sensor is to be accessed by OBC.

        The power line is controlled and protected by a Latchup-Current Limiter FPF2701MX placed on the EPS board. Therefore, additional latchup protection in not necessary in this design. However, this sensor will not be the only one on the PLD board and should have its own power switch. The PLD board is enabled and disabled by EPS on the OBC command and the sensor should be enabled only during TID readout. Having this in mind forces the design to be immune to immediate shutdowns and dose have to be accumulated off-line.

    \subsection{Power consumption}
        During irradiation sensor should be completely turned off. It decreases possibility of radiation damage and increases overall system reliability.

        During readout the required power should be less than \SI{1}{W}.

    \subsection{Data interface}
        The sensor is connected to the OBC via the $I^2C$ interface. On this bus, OBC is the master, while the sensor is one of the slaves. The PLD board can be disabled and can therefore provide isolation of the $I^2C$ bus when it is powered off.

    \subsection{Radiation immunity}
        The design should itself be immune to radiation. For PW-Sat2, a threshold of \SI{10}{\kilo\rad} was chosen for all COTS components. Semiconductors should have radiation tests as described in \cite{ESCIES_TID_test_method}.

    \subsection{Electromagnetic compatibility}
        EMC requirements are described in \cite{ECSS_E_ST_20_07C}. This standard was tailored to PW-Sat2 because the power rail is \SI{+5}{\volt}, rather than the (\SI{+28}{\volt}) featured on bigger spacecraft.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Conducted susceptibility is shown in the figure \ref{EMC_conducted_susceptibility} . It was created by down-scaling figure A-4 from \cite{ECSS_E_ST_20_07C} by factor of $\SI{28}{\volt}/\SI{5}{\volt} = 5.6$. The EMC limit on the power line is defined as a constant \SI{175}{\milli\volt} from \SI{30}{\hertz} to \SI{100}{\kilo\hertz}. The sensor should be able to filter this ripple to produce stable power for analog devices. In addition, it should be taken into account that output DC-DC converters on EPS run at \SI{500}{\kilo\hertz}.

            \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.5\paperwidth]{img/04/EMC_conducted_susceptibility.eps}
                \caption{Conducted susceptibility limit, frequency domain. Source: \cite{ECSS_E_ST_20_07C}}
                \label{EMC_conducted_susceptibility}
            \end{figure}


            \item Conducted emission is defined in the figure \ref{EMC_conducted_emission}.

            \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.5\paperwidth]{img/04/EMC_conducted_emission.eps}
                \caption{Conducted susceptibility limit, frequency domain. Source: \cite{ECSS_E_ST_20_07C}}
                \label{EMC_conducted_emission}
            \end{figure}


            \item Radiated susceptibility.
                On board PW-Sat2 is a communication module transmitting \SI{0.5}{\watt} of power at \SI{435.02}{\mega\hertz}. It is planned that during readout, the radio transmitter will be disabled, but proper tests should be conducted to check for possible errors and faults.

                PLD board is placed near OBC - so radiated emissions from digital lines can potentially couple to sensor elements causing noise and errors. Proper tests will be conducted and if necessary shielding will be implemented.

            \item Radiated emission.
                The sensor is not predicted to emit any kind of radio waves. In case of any detected anomalies, further design decisions would have to be made.

        \end{itemize}


    \subsection{Inrush current}
        Inrush current has to be limited to maximum power consumption to not trigger LCL on EPS (\SI{0.5}{\ampere}).

    \subsection{Reliability of components}
        This sensor is not a critical part of the satellite. Nonetheless, reliable components should be used to ensure proper results.

        Every used component should have a failure rate of $0.1\si{\percent}$ or lower. This is essential in capacitors and other passive components.

\section{Mechanical requirements}
    In this chapter design constraints and mechanical requirements of Falcon9 are presented. Launcher requirements were taken from \cite{Falcon9_user_manual}.

    \subsection{PCB}
    \label{PCB_description}
        PCB of PLD board is standard 4-layer FR4 board with stack shown in the figure \ref{PLD_PCB_stack}. Its dimensions are shown in the figure \ref{PLD_PCB_size}. The sensor design must, of course, occupy only a small amount of space on the board. For the sensor footprint, the limits are \SI{3x3}{\centi\meter} double sided.

        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.7\paperwidth]{img/04/PLD_PCB_stack.png}
            \caption{PLD board PCB stack}
            \label{PLD_PCB_stack}
        \end{figure}

        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.7\paperwidth]{img/04/PC104_PLD_size.png}
            \caption{PC-104 size}
            \label{PLD_PCB_size}
        \end{figure}



    \subsection{Outgassing}
        Every component used should be able to work in vacuum. Outgassing of components should be known to conduct required vacuum tests before launch. Too great an outgassing coefficient can result in damage to the turbomolecular pump in the vacuum chamber.

    \subsection{Vibration}
        During the rocket launch, large vibrations occur on the payload, therefore the rocket payload should be immune to vibration. In the case of heavy electronic components, appropriate glue should be applied to prevent joint cracks.
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.5\paperwidth]{img/04/Falcon9_vibration.eps}
            \caption{Falcon9 maximum axial equivalent sine environment. Source: \cite{Falcon9_user_manual}}
            \label{Falcon9_vibration}
        \end{figure}


    \subsection{Operation temperature}
        The sensor should work in every operational case a satellite can be. Simulations were performed to find the boundaries of the  possible temperature range inside the satellite.    In \cite{PWSAT_TCS_CDR} results are presented.

        For the PLD board, the operation range is $\SI{0}{\degreeCelsius}$ to $\SI{60}{\degreeCelsius}$. If the measured temperature is outside this range, the sensor will not be enabled.


    \subsection{Thermal cycles}
        On the PW-Sat2 orbit, the sun illumination is changing every $\approx \SI{90}{\minute}$. Therefore a large number of thermal cycles are applied to the On-Board electronics, which can cause joint cracks as well as component failures. Proper soldering and component selection will be made, according to ECSS.

        As described in \cite{ECSS_Q_ST_70_04C} the sensor should pass thermal cycle tests: $100$ times from $- (100 \pm 5)$\si{\degreeCelsius} to $(100 \pm 5)$\si{\degreeCelsius} in a vacuum environment. This will be tested on Qualification Model.
