\chapter{Engineering model}
This chapter will describe engineering model developed during this thesis. 

This model should be as close to flight model as possible - but it could be e.g. on separate board, which is this case. 

This model was developed as flight-ready version for sensor calibration \& tests along with developing \& testing flight software.
