\chapter{Sensor prototypes}
During development of the system two previous models were developed. Their aim was to show concept of the sensor, as well as conduct tests required to improve design.

\section{Demonstration model}
    First developed design was demonstration model. It was design for flexibility in terms of connectivity, possible MOSFET sensor, current source etc. 

    On this model, two possible MOSFET sensors were tested:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 3N163
        \item CD4007
    \end{itemize}


\section{Calibration stand}
    Calibration stand was developed by M. Gumiela in his engineering thesis \cite{MGThesis}. The basic goal was to develop measurement device which can be used to determine final operational point, calibrate radiation response and to perform temperature calibration of flight sensor.
