\chapter{Design requirements}

In this chapter the requirement for the TID sensor will be presented.

Sensor is designed to be flown on-board of PW-Sat2 satellite. Therefore it should be designed for it's particular requirements. In addition, it should be designed having in mind active space standard and launcher requirements.


\section{PW-Sat2 mission}
Presented sensor is scheduled to be launched on PW-Sat2 satellite \cite{PW-Sat2URL}.

\subsection{Main purpose}
\subsection{Orbit \& lifetime}
\subsection{Radiation analysis}
This sensor is planned to be used on satellites orbiting on LEO (Low Earth Orbit - between $200$ and $2000 km$ \cite{ORDEM2000}). Therefore, simulations in SPENVIS was performed to determine TID accumulated on this types of orbit.
